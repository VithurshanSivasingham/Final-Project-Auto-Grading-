# Final-Project-Auto-Grading-
In this project, I've developed a sophisticated grading system that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) techniques. Designed primarily for educators and students, this system automates the grading process for essays uploaded as text files, providing comprehensive feedback on various aspects of the writing.
